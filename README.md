# AirBnb-Data-Analysis
I worked on a Data Set from Kaggle which contained details about homes, loactions, their sizes and so much more. I made Data Visualizations using Power BI, examined and cleaned the data in Jupyter Notebooks and make a few data Models and Predictions
You will notice the machine learning methods I use are Random Forests and Tree Classifiers, however the models were not very accurate. Other machine learning methods can be applied.
